# Native semantic providers

The Go migration uses the existing [resolution](resolution.md) and
[analysis](analysis.md) contracts. Native providers own their compiler integration
and vocabulary in the [agnostic semantic graph](semantics.md). They do not depend
on Horos, Logos, generation plugins or runtime bindings. The
[joint verifier](verification.md) consumes these established facts and
explicit native queries alongside its separate Horos evidence.

## Composition and ownership

```text
captured, syntax-admitted ASTs
  -> resolve/files/golang/go -> go/ast -> go/types
  -> immutable declarations, bindings, type terms, facts and reports
  -> analyze/files/golang/go (explicit resolution receipt; reuses the graph)
  -> semantics/golang/go (typed read-only view)
  -> explicit native query session, when a consumer needs admission checking
```

Resolution and type checking are coupled inside `go/types`. The resolver declares
both responsibilities; analysis consumes its exact compatible receipt without
running the compiler again. Syntax admission still permits unresolved names.
There is no language switch in the engine and no automatic registration.
`provider/golang/go` supplies independent `NewFilesResolver` and
`NewFilesAnalyzer` constructors, as well as direct typed delegates.

The package layout is:

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `semantics/golang/go` | Go-owned vocabulary, environment identity and immutable typed graph readers |
| `internal/golangsem` | Direct AST bridge, bounded compiler invocation and fact export |
| `resolve/files/golang/go` | Configured resolution, coverage and native validity reports |
| `analyze/files/golang/go` | Receipt-consuming analysis and explicit compiler-backed admission queries |
| `provider/golang/go` | Independent role composition |
| `integration/go` | Provider, environment, coverage and graph qualification |
| `verification/files/horos-to-go/go` | Joint representation claims using the native provider results |

The former `verification/files/target/golang/go` projection is removed. No
compatibility entry point remains. No type-generation behavior changes.

## First Go profile

The supported subset remains the captured type-declaration fragment: one supplied
package across at most 16 files, defined types and aliases, generic parameters and
applications, named/predeclared types, slices, ordinary struct fields and tags,
embedded interface type terms, approximations and unions. Imported packages,
methods, embedded struct fields, pointer/array/map/function types and executable
bodies remain unsupported. Syntax acceptance does not promise semantic coverage.

The language version is Go 1.25, the package path is `captured`, and the only
external scope is the predeclared universe. The native compiler is the `go/types`
library linked into the process; its actual Go toolchain version is part of the
required request configuration. Sizes are explicitly `gc/amd64`, matching the
previous default. CI qualifies Go 1.27.3. The provider does not discover a project,
read ambient packages, resolve imports or download dependencies. Changing any of
these environment choices requires a deliberate profile change.

Every result records separate coverage, binding and validity reports. A native
type error gives a rejected validity report with a captured-node diagnostic;
unsupported syntax gives unsupported coverage; exhausted bounds give incomplete
reports. None publishes partial semantics. Invalid configuration, forged supplied
references, foreign receipts and cancellation remain operation errors. Native
checking is synchronous: cancellation is checked around compiler calls and does
not claim to preempt `go/types` while it runs.

The graph contains package/type/alias/parameter/field entities, resolved name
bindings, expression terms and generic applications. Go-owned facts retain
underlying types, alias targets, constraints, instantiated fields and native type
identity. Aliases remain distinguishable from definitions even when Go considers
their types identical. IDs belong to that exact model, never to a spelling.

`semantics/golang.Open` admits the analysis receipt and reads this graph without
compilation. Native `NewQueries` is a separate, explicit operation: it rebuilds
compiler state from the same capture and environment and checks correspondence
with the published graph. A query session retains that state privately, with no
compiler pointers in the generic graph, hidden cache or callback attachment.
`Admit` checks generic instantiation with `types.Instantiate(..., true)` and binds
its answer to the model, constructor and arguments. It proves native argument
admission only, not Horos membership or representation preservation. Query sessions
serialize compiler queries; immutable semantic views may be read concurrently.

## Extension to the other native languages

The same roles and receipt contracts apply, with language-owned facts and query
semantics. There is no universal `Compatible` predicate and no Bittype
reimplementation of all native type systems.

| Language | Planned authority and initial semantic surface |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript | Pinned official Compiler API helper; symbols, aliases/interfaces, generics, unions, optional members and structural assignability. Current native qualification uses 5.9.3; API upgrades are explicit. |
| Rust | Toolchain-pinned `rustc_driver` helper; declaration/path identity, generic predicates and instantiation, later associated-type normalization. Compiler internals are unstable. |
| C++ | Pinned Clang LibTooling helper; declarations, template parameters/applications and constraint checking. |

Public orchestration stays in Go; compiler helpers may use their native language.
Compiler version, language edition, flags, target and dependency environment must
be explicit. Helpers must not discover or download an ambient dependency closure.
Compilers that require source consume captured files with verified AST/file
correspondence. Checking emitted source is an explicit new capture; it cannot be
silently printed/reparsed and presented as analysis of the original AST.

Future providers distinguish missing context, unsupported coverage, resource
exhaustion and proven invalidity. Their first slices should publish no partial
models. Native semantic checking remains separate from
[type generation](semantic-generation.md), [native admission](go-native-admission.md)
and the [joint verification contract](verification.md).
